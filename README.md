Daily Update:

○`03/18/2024`
  - Already Created UI (Electron.js)
  - Tried to develop a code for conversion of pdf to excel 
    (Found lots of python libraries but not accurate, found API accurate but must be paid).
  - Managed to develop a code for splitting PDF Pages.
  - Managed to develop a code for Merging PDF pages.
  - Next Plan - Switch to nodejs because python doesnt auto install libraries/modules when electronjs is packaged/built.

○ `03/19/2024`
  - Developed a node.js code that converts pdf file into excel file using the API
    pdfrest(pdf to excel conversion API) for free without watermarks and no limitations
    on pages to be converted `test.js`.
  - Next Plan - Fix the merge Excel files to retain the formatting, Organize the codes and be ready for the finalization of the project
